# Export Functionality Test Instructions

## How to Test the Export Options

1. **Navigate to the Data Visualization page**
   - Go to the main application
   - Click on the "Data Visualization" tab

2. **Select a Location for Trend Analysis**
   - Scroll down to the "Individual Location Trend Analysis" section
   - Select a location from the dropdown (e.g., "Trivandrum, South India")
   - Wait for the trend data to load

3. **Test the Export Dropdown**
   - Look for the red "Export" button in the top-right corner of the trend chart
   - The button should now have a dropdown arrow (▼) indicator
   - Click on the "Export" button

4. **Verify Export Options**
   You should see a dropdown menu with these options:
   
   **PDF Export:**
   - "PDF with Charts" - Includes the trend charts in the PDF
   - "PDF Data Only" - Only includes the data tables (faster, smaller file)
   
   **Excel Export:**
   - "Excel (CSV)" - Downloads the data as a CSV file compatible with Excel
   
   **Cancel:**
   - Closes the dropdown without exporting

5. **Test Each Export Option**
   - Click on each option to test the export functionality
   - Each export should show a loading state ("Exporting...")
   - Files should download automatically with appropriate names:
     - `location_trend_analysis_with_charts_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
     - `location_trend_analysis_data_only_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
     - `location_trend_analysis_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Dropdown Visibility**: The dropdown should appear when clicking the Export button
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Button shows loading state during export
✅ **File Downloads**: Each option should trigger a file download
✅ **Click Outside**: Dropdown should close when clicking outside
✅ **Cancel Option**: Cancel button should close the dropdown

## Troubleshooting

If the dropdown doesn't appear:
1. Make sure you have selected a location with trend data
2. Check that the Export button is not disabled
3. Try refreshing the page and selecting the location again

If exports don't work:
1. Check the browser's download folder
2. Check for any pop-up blockers
3. Verify the export completes without errors

## Recent Improvements Made

- Increased z-index from z-10 to z-50 for better dropdown visibility
- Added transition effects for smoother hover states
- Improved click-outside handler with specific container class
