# Map Dropdown Fix Summary

## Problem
In the map view, when users tried to change the HPI dropdown selection, the dropdown options were hidden behind the map component.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by z-index layering problems between the dropdown menu and the Leaflet map component.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CSS-based Z-index Management
Created a dedicated CSS file (`/src/styles/map-dropdown.css`) with proper z-index hierarchy:

```css
/* Map dropdown z-index fix */
.map-dropdown-container {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1000;
}

.map-dropdown-content {
  z-index: 9999 !important;
}

.leaflet-container {
  z-index: 1;
}

/* Ensure dropdown appears above all map elements */
.leaflet-control-container {
  z-index: 999;
}

.leaflet-top-pane {
  z-index: 998;
}

/* Additional fix for dropdown positioning */
[data-radix-select-content] {
  z-index: 9999 !important;
}
```

### 2. Component Updates
- Updated `MapView` component to import the CSS file
- Applied `map-dropdown-container` class to dropdown containers
- Applied `map-dropdown-content` class to SelectContent component

### 3. Implementation Details
- The dropdown container has z-index: 1000
- The dropdown content has z-index: 9999 (highest priority)
- The map container has z-index: 1 (lowest priority)
- Added specific targeting for Radix UI select content

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/map-view.tsx` - Updated dropdown implementation
2. `/src/styles/map-dropdown.css` - New CSS file with z-index fixes

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
- Dropdown options appear above the map when opened
- Map functionality remains unaffected
- Dropdown styling and behavior remain consistent
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Result
Users can now successfully interact with the HPI dropdown menu in the map view without options being hidden behind the map.
